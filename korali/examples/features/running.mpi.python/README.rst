Running Python MPI Applications
=====================================================

In this tutorial we show how a Python MPI model can be executed with Korali.

For more information on running Korali applications in parallel, see :ref:`Parallel Execution <parallel-execution>`. 
For more information on running Korali on MPI, see :ref:`Distributed Conduit <module-conduit-distributed>`. 

MPI Init
---------------------------

Do not forget to init MPI inside the Korali application:

.. code-block:: python

    from mpi4py import MPI

Distributed Conduit
---------------------------

Run with the `Distributed` conduit to benefit from parallelized model evaluations.
Note that we need to provide it with the MPI communicator we want to use for this instance of Korali.
Next, we set `Ranks Per Worker` to determine how many MPI ranks will be assigned to each Korali worker. This particular example uses 4 MPI ranks per worker.

.. code-block:: python

    k.setMPIComm(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    k["Conduit"]["Type"] = "Distributed";
    k["Conduit"]["Ranks Per Worker"] = 4;
    
Profiling
---------------------------
    
In some cases it might be useful to activate Korali's internal profiler to analyze
how efficiently workers executed. To enable it, add the following option:

.. code-block:: python

    k["Profiling"]["Detail"] = "Full";
    k["Profiling"]["Frequency"] = 0.5;
    
Computational Model
---------------------------
    
If the computational model requires communication between the MPI ranks, you need to obtain the worker-specific sub-communicator

.. code-block:: python

    import korali
    ...
    comm = korali.getWorkerMPIComm()
    rank = comm.Get_rank()
    size = comm.Get_size()

Run CMAES
---------------------------

To launch CMAES, use the corresponding MPI launcher, with a number of MPI ranks that equals k*n+1, where `k` is the number of Korali workers to use, `n` is the number of MPI Ranks per worker, and 1 MPI rank is assigned to the Korali engine.  
In this example, we launch two workers with 4 ranks each, hence we need 9 MPI ranks. 

.. code-block:: bash

    mpirun -n 9 ./run-cmaes.py

Run VRACER
---------------------------

To launch VRACER, use the corresponding MPI launcher, with a number of MPI ranks that equals k*n+1, where `k` is the number of Korali workers to use, `n` is the number of MPI Ranks per worker, and 1 MPI rank is assigned to the Korali engine.  
In this example, we launch 4 concurrent environments with 1 rank each, hence we ned 5 MPI Ranks.

.. code-block:: bash

    mpirun -n 5 ./run-vracer.py --numWorkers 4
